# Description
This code is used to produce plots in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04458). The code is invoked as follows:

- plot_audio.py – produces bar plots of entropy and similarity score (audio similarity metric) for audio data in our experiments.
- plot_gas.py – produces bar plots of entropy and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance for CO2 and TVOC data in our experiments.
- plot_light.py – produces bar plots for entropy and DTW distance for illuminance and RGB data in our experiments.

The above scripts are launced on the results data found inside the **hardzipa-results** folder on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8263497).
